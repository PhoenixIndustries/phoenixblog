When updates are available Manjaro will just show an unobtrusive notification. If you have important work to do, are currently in a ranked game or watching a movie, you can just hide it with one click. "Not now" for us still means that you don't have time and don't want to update right now. There are no hidden downloads or automatic restarts. Manjaro does exactly what you want.
