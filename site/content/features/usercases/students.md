Manjaro's repository of free and quality software is filled with programs for each subject. For mathematics, simple to advanced calculations can be done using scientific calculators like [Qalculate!](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/qalculate-gtk) or [SpeedCrunch](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/speedcrunch) that don't just copy the experience of most hardware-calculators, but allow free editing of functions and terms.

For more complex mathematics, [Cantor](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/cantor) Teachers love [Geogebra](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/geogebra) to show physics, trigonometry, vector operations and more for its easy-to-use graphical editing of mathematical relations, plotting of functions and setting constraints.

Physics including molecular dynamics, gravitation and coloumb forces and more can be taught using [Step](https://www.kde.org/applications/education/step/). The earth can be explored with [Marble](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/marble), while the sky and stars can be viewed with [Stellarium](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/stellarium).

[Minuet](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/minuet)) brings a software for music education that teaches students ear training, rhythm, harmony and more and provides features for teachers to create individual lessons.

Learning is also important for the youngest. [Gcompris](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/gcompris-qt) allows them to play and learn basics of a computer, elementary mathematics, geography, reading and many other things. Included are also games like puzzles, chess, memory and more that will make learning a pleasant and funny experience.

Organizing things is important, too. The Manjaro repository contains software like [Thunderbird](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/thunderbird) that provides an E-Mail client, a calendar and a news-reader.

To write homework or to create presentations, [LibreOffice](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/libreoffice-still) comes preinstalled.
