Manjaro's repositories contain the latest available versions of popular software like the statistic language [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the scripting language [Python](https://discover.manjaro.org/packages/python) and more. Also [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), additional packages for it and software like [Lyx](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/lyx) or [TeXstudio](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/texstudio) are readily available and can be installed with just a few clicks. With LaTeX scientists can create high-quality documents and presentations with included math-formulas, chemical molecules, self-updating cross- and literature references and more without being restrained by a specific style or document type. Lyx encapsulates LaTeX in a friendly GUI for people who don't have much experience with LaTeX.

Additional modules for R, Python, [Perl](https://discover.manjaro.org/packages/perl) and others are either available directly through Manjaro's repositories or can be compiled and installed with programs like [pip](https://discover.manjaro.org/packages/python-pip) or the integrated package management of R.

No additional software is required, as all needed build tools are pre-installed. Experimental data can be analyzed with [LabPlot](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/labplot).
