Vector-graphics can be done with programs such as [Inkscape](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/inkscape).

For simple or advanced video-editing, [Kdenlive](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/kdenlive) and [OpenShot](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/openshot) will do almost anything you need.

3D-Modelling can be done using [Blender](https://discover.manjaro.org/applications/blender). Codecs for video and audio come pre-installed or are automatically fetched. Most of this software is freely available and can be easily and securely installed using Manjaro's integrated package manager.
